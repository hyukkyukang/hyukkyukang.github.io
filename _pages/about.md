Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the [Data Systems Lab](http://dslab.postech.ac.kr) at [Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)](http://postech.ac.kr). I am doing research under the supervision of [Professor Wook-Shin Han](https://wscrony.github.io). My research interests are in the area of natural language processing, machine learning, and database management systems. Currently, I am working on Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation.
